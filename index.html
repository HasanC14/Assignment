        <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk, threatened
            by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded into emergency
            flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and homes
            have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been closed or impacted.
